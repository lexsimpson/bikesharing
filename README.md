## Overview
Last summer a friend and I took a trip to NYC, fell in love with citi bikes and would like to create a similar business back home in Iowa. The purpose of this analysis is to use the data in order to create a business proposal for a bike sharing comapany in Iowa.

Most people check out the bikes for 5-10 minutes

## Summary
* In summary, the typical user of this service is a male subscriber, riding the bike for 5-10 minutes, between the hours of 7-9am and 5-7pm M-F.
* Another visualization I would look into is the stations being used to get an idea of where to place new stations in Iowa. For example, if they should be close to downtown or more subburbs on the outside of town.
* The last visualization I would do is a graph on birth year to know more about what age range to market the product to.
